# Welcome to WebNN Docs

[WebNN Docs](https://github.com/webmachinelearning/webnn-docs) is an open-source, collaborative project that documents Web Neural Network (WebNN) API.

## Build the site

To set up the site locally, you need to have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) installed. You can check if these are installed by running the following commands:

```bash
node -v
```

After you have installed Node.js, you can install the dependencies:

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

Once started, a live preview is available at `http://localhost:3000`.
