## NPU Errors

### NPU utilization not visible in Windows Task Manager when running on WebNN NPU

#### Problem

NPU (Neural Processing Unit) utilization does not appear in Windows Task Manager when running WebNN applications on NPU, e.g. [Whisper Base on NPU](https://microsoft.github.io/webnn-developer-preview/demos/whisper-base/?devicetype=npu), even after installing the latest NPU driver.

#### Cause

Windows Update may automatically replace Intel.com drivers with older OEM-distributed versions on devices from manufacturers like Lenovo, ASUS, Dell, and HP. This behavior affects both Neural Processor (NPU, Intel AI Boost) and Graphics drivers.

#### Current status and improvements

A new NPU driver release in early 2026 is expected to be the solution to resolve this issue.

#### Alternative: Using WebNN with default drivers and launch browser with switch [`--disable_webnn_for_npu=0`](../../api-reference/browser-compatibility/chrome-flags#--disable_webnn_for_npu)

In many cases, WebNN NPU functionality works with the default OEM-provided drivers that come with Windows Update. 

If stability is more important than having the absolute latest driver version, launch browser with switch [`--disable_webnn_for_npu=0`](../../api-reference/browser-compatibility/chrome-flags#--disable_webnn_for_npu) to enable WebNN NPU functionality in Chrome or Edge.

<div className="ort-ep">
```shell
"%LOCALAPPDATA%\Google\Chrome SxS\Application\chrome.exe" --disable_webnn_for_npu=0
```
</div>

<div className="ort-ep">
```shell
"%LOCALAPPDATA%\Microsoft\Edge SxS\Application\msedge.exe" --disable_webnn_for_npu=0
```
</div>

## GPU Errors

### Graphics driver rollbacks affecting WebNN GPU performance

#### Problem

Windows Update automatically reverts graphics drivers to previous versions, preventing WebNN from achieving optimal GPU performance.
